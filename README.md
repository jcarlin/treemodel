# treemodel
===========
Create a Tree Model concept to encompass the natural heirarchal data structure (ex. sales orders - line items - line item - line item detail). 

#### This test app does _not_ include:
- login (hardcoded login params required in main.cpp)
- further nested classes
- multiple TreeModels
- interface class for ui to call, this class could also handle the proper assembly of the tree model and items 

#### Other features or benefits of a tree model might include: 
- lazy loading, eager loading and asynchornous querying and assembly of data
